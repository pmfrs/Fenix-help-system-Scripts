# Fenix-help-system-Scripts
ISCTE-IUL - Informatics Engineering Masters - Technologies for Operational Information Systems - 2017

Scripts developed in order to provide a better help system for FÃ©nix a platform used in ISCTE-IUL. 
Main goal is to prove that learning by an automated script with visualization is better that the current help manuals. 
A GUI was developed in order to invoke the scripts (available here: https://github.com/pmfrs/Fenix-help-system-GUI)
